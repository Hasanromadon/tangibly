## üîß **AI Agent Configuration**

### **Recommended AI Agent Settings**

```yaml
AI_AGENT_CONFIG:
  project_type: "full-stack-nextjs"
  language: "typescript"
  framework: "nextjs-15"
  testing_framework: "jest-playwright"
  database: "postgresql-prisma"
  auth_system: "jwt-rbac"
  code_style: "eslint-prettier"
  architecture: "solid-principles"
  coverage_target: "70%"
```

### **Essential Knowledge Base**

Ensure your AI agent has access to:

- `README.md` - Project overview and setup
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Code patterns and principles
- `API_DOCS.md` - Backend API reference
- `TESTING_SETUP.md` - Testing guidelines
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

## üéØ **Development Workflow Prompts**

### **Starting New Feature**

```
"I need to implement [FEATURE]. Please:
1. Analyze existing similar features in the codebase
2. Review the architecture patterns for this type of feature
3. Propose a implementation plan following our SOLID principles
4. Create the necessary components, API routes, and tests
5. Ensure proper TypeScript typing and error handling"
```

### **Debugging Issues**

```
"I'm experiencing [ISSUE] in the Tangibly app. Please:
1. Analyze the error and potential root causes
2. Check related Frontend and Backend code
3. Review our error handling patterns
4. Propose a fix that maintains code quality
5. Suggest tests to prevent regression"
```

### **Code Optimization**

```
"Please optimize [COMPONENT/FEATURE] for:
1. Performance - following our performance guidelines
2. Security - adhering to our security standards
3. Maintainability - improving code organization
4. Testing - enhancing test coverage and quality
5. Documentation - updating relevant docs"
```

### **Refactoring Tasks**

```
"Refactor [CODE_SECTION] to:
1. Better follow SOLID principles
2. Improve TypeScript type safety
3. Enhance Frontend/Backend separation
4. Add missing tests and documentation
5. Maintain backward compatibility"
```

## üìö **Reference Commands**

### **Architecture & Patterns**

```
"Show me the established pattern for [authentication/forms/API routes/state management]"
"How should I implement [feature] following our architecture guidelines?"
"What's the correct way to handle [errors/loading states/validation] in this project?"
```

### **Testing & Quality**

```
"Generate comprehensive tests for [component/feature]"
"Check test coverage and suggest improvements"
"Review this code for security vulnerabilities"
"Validate this implementation against our coding standards"
```

### **Documentation**

```
"Update documentation for [new feature/changes]"
"Generate API documentation for [endpoints]"
"Create usage examples for [component/utility]"
"Update README with [new information]"
```

## ‚ö° **Efficiency Tips**

### **1. Always Provide Context**

```
// Good:
"In the Tangibly asset management system, I need to add a new asset creation form that integrates with our existing auth system and follows our React Hook Form + Zod validation patterns."

// Bad:
"Add a form for creating assets."
```

### **2. Reference Existing Patterns**

```
// Good:
"Follow the same pattern as the user registration form in src/app/auth/register/page.tsx"

// Bad:
"Create a form with validation."
```

### **3. Specify Both FE and BE Requirements**

```
// Good:
"Implement user profile editing with:
- Frontend: React component with form validation
- Backend: API route with auth middleware and database updates
- Both: Proper error handling and TypeScript types"

// Bad:
"Add user profile editing."
```

### **4. Include Testing Requirements**

```
// Good:
"Add comprehensive tests including unit tests for utilities, component tests for React components, and API tests for endpoints."

// Bad:
"Add some tests."
```

## üö® **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

### **‚ùå Don't Say:**

- "Add a simple component" (specify requirements)
- "Fix this bug" (provide context and constraints)
- "Make it work" (define success criteria)
- "Add some validation" (specify validation rules)

### **‚úÖ Instead Say:**

- "Add a TypeScript component following our shadcn/ui patterns with proper props interface"
- "Fix this authentication bug while maintaining our JWT security standards"
- "Implement this feature to meet our 70% test coverage and accessibility requirements"
- "Add Zod validation following our established schema patterns"
